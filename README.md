## Preface 

The goal of this project is to create a static website to showcase my portfolio. This project uses 
[HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) for the content and 
structure of the document, [CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) for the 
styles and animations, [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) for the behaviors and 
logic of the website. Besides, it uses a simple storage service named [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to host 
the static website.
